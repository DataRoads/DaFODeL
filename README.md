DaFODeL
=======

DaFODeL is short for *Da*ta *F*low *O*bject *De*sign *L*anguage, a visual flow-centric programming language, and is pronounced like "daffodil". Data always flows down, Y down length represents "flow rate" or relative processing time in big-O notation, and X across width represents relative data flow size or I/O band-width needed. Colors represent data types or schema mixes, and background "pages" can be used to represent processor I/O (data X width) and per-cycle calculations (processing Y depth) capabilities for a given target platform.
